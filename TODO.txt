✔   Different Node Pieces
        - World should call AddNode(point, NodeArg)
            Type        Orientation
            -----------------------
            full        n/a
            half        Up | Left | Down | Right    (Direction)
            curve       one | two | three | four    (Quadrant)

            - type NodeArg struct {
                type, Orientation
            }

✔   Adding Objects and Enemies to the Course
        - Write AddEnemy and AddItem methods for World

    Item Special Cases:
        - longer than just 1 block
        - linked items (portals)

    More Node Information
        - default connections
        - settability
        * All combinations should be valid
